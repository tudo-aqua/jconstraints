We added a couple of SMT-Problems for unit-testing purpose to this repository.
Most of them are taken from the existing body of literature on string solving and have been previously collected in the following git:
https://git.zs.informatik.uni-kiel.de/dbp/wordbenchmarks/-/tree/d9072e19461a50a570792f41a7d438da3610b9f5/models

The jbmc-regression_StringMiscellaneous03_Main_10.smt2 Problem has been generated by JDart and
is owned by us. We release it under Apache 2.0 along with the rest of the code base.

problem_2__008.smt2 has its own origin header.
